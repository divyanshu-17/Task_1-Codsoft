# 🛳️ Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses the classic Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, sex, passenger class, fare, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict passenger survival using classification.
- **Dataset:** [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 🧠 Features Used

- Pclass – Ticket class  
- Sex – Gender  
- Age – Age in years  
- SibSp – Siblings/spouses aboard  
- Parch – Parents/children aboard  
- Fare – Ticket fare  
- Embarked – Port of embarkation

## 🚀 Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Handle missing values
3. Encode categorical variables
4. Split into train/test sets
5. Train a Random Forest Classifier
6. Evaluate with accuracy and confusion matrix
7. Plot feature importance
